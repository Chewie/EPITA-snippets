About
-----

This is a collection of snippets for ultisnips that are compliant with
the EPITA norms. If you are not a student of EPITA, then those files are of
little interest to you.

These are snippets for **ultisnips**, not for snipmate.
You can get ultisnips [here](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)

Installation
------------

Copy the files in the UltiSnips directory. If you installed ultisnips with
pathogen, then you can create your own ULtiSnips directory in .vim, these
snippets will override the preexisting ones.
